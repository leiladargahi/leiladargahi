  <b>About</b>
  <br/>
A software developer and University Lecturer . I have worked independently and gained a good knowledge of programming languages and the software development life cycle. I love writing well-organized and clean code.  I am always open to feedback and never miss a chance to give ideas to improve the status quo. I love everything about learning new things and have no attachment to any framework, language, etc. To sum it up, an enthusiast learner, a neat coder, a helpful developer, and a stubborn problem solver with a great sense and flexibility.
